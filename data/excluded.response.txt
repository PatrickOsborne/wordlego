Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint its exact level of obscurity. However, compared to very rare or technical terms, "bonbo" might be considered relatively uncommon and recognizable in certain niches.
bomos: True. The word "bomos" is not a commonly used term in everyday language. However, it has been identified as an invalid word in some dictionaries and linguistic resources.

The reason is that "bomos" seems to be derived from Latin, but it doesn't correspond to any recognized Latin word or root. In fact, it's possible that someone created this word by combining parts of other words, which could make it seem more obscure or made-up than a naturally occurring word.

If you're interested in learning about the possible etymology or usage of "bomos", I can try to help you dig deeper!

In informal contexts, particularly in the United States, "booby" can refer to a trap or an illusion designed to deceive someone.

However, considering its widespread usage in English language contexts, such as formal speeches, literature, and everyday conversation, I would say that the word is not uncommon.

That being said, if you're asking about the word's frequency of use in certain domains or contexts where it might be less common, then that could be a different story. For example:

- In some academic or professional settings, "honor" might be used more frequently in certain fields than others (e.g., law, politics).
- In everyday conversation, people might use words like "respect," "recognition," or "respectability" instead of "honor."

inmew: True. "Inmew" is a rare or obsolete spelling of the word "inmuwe", which is an archaic or poetic way of saying "in new". However I could not find any evidence that it has ever been used in modern English, so its status as true obscure, is subjective.
inorg: True. The word "inorg" is an abbreviation for "inorganic", which refers to something that is not derived from organic matter. However, it is a relatively uncommon term, and more commonly, people use the full word "inorganic".

A more common word that comes from this combination is "insoluble", but even that word has a more specific meaning (i.e., unable to be solved or dissolved) rather than simply carefree or nonchalant.

Therefore, I would say that the word "insol" is generally considered obscure and uncommon in modern English.
intue: True. The correct spelling is "intuit", but as written, "intue" appears to be a misspelling of the word. If you meant to type "intuit", it would be a fairly common and well-known word in English. However, if this is indeed the original typo, then I'd rate the frequency of use of "intue" as very low or rare.

In terms of usage, "Irwin" can be considered a relatively common surname, especially in English-speaking countries like the US and UK. However, as a given name, it's less frequent and might be classified as uncommon or mid-tier in terms of popularity.
